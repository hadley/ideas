IG toolkit for longitudinal data
================================

Should be easy to:

  * standardise: index, log transform, mean/var, 0-1
  * remove seasonal effects
  * smooth
  * cluster


Clustering
----------

Interaction between dendrogram (+ mds) and individual timeseries.  Why was this line put in this cluster?  Manually tweak clustering.  Add explanations and descriptions.
