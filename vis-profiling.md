Profiling and performance 
==========================

Correct the code in profr.  Provide test cases.
Work with memory profiling tools as well.

Provide interactive view using klimt?

See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/papers/rFinanceHPC.pdf for other ideas.

Script to run R code, executing each line individually and recording the amount of time it takes.  

For very fast functions, should be able to run function many times, and combine profiling results over runs.  Or should be able to run over multiple functions to see what is slow over many of them.
