Spatial displays with ggplot2 ================================================

Not a GIS, but need to be able to provide geographic-statistical displays.  Develop links with City University group (Jason Dykes etc).

  * decent set of reference maps for R, or at least good description of sources
  * better system for dealing with projections
  * reread Bertin and implement ideas, random fill density maps
  * implementation of cartograms
  * support for voronoi tesselations in ggplot
  * survey cartographic literature for ideas

Decent thinning algorithms.
Decent conversion from one data type to another.

Better contours:
  * lines
  * filled "Hypsometric Tinting" - http://blogs.esri.com/Support/blogs/mappingcenter/archive/2008/05/09/hypsometric-tinting.aspx
  * lovely map contours: http://www.nagt.org/files/nagt/jge/abstracts/Kennelly_v50n4p428.pdf
