# Better variable typing

* measured vs. id
* ordinal, linear, ratio etc.
* time / space
* explanatory vs. response
* most important etc.

* groups for v. large numbers of variables
  * longitudinal
  * hierarchical

* other types of missing values

Given variable types, can we use them to create better types of display - how can we suggest better visualisations using this information.
