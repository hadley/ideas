Image manipulation detection with interactive graphics =======================
  
This presentation and code develop a number of pixel-level statistics that are useful for detecting image manipulation.  The presentation uses static graphics (e.g. 3d scatterplots) and image plots with statistics mapped to colour.

Uses:

* inspect famous spoof pictures
* dubious media imagery

Output

* Implement statistics in R (rgb, wavelets, quality)
* Develop tile plot for ggobi
* Develop image grand tour
* Technique to display selected pixels, independent of their colour

Maybe use ideas from this paper, http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf, (content aware image resizing) as another possible index.
