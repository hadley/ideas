Displaying the results of linear models
=======================================

After you've fit a model and discovered that some of the terms are significant, what do you do next? Particularly what do you do if interactions are significant? How should you display the results?

Still needs a lot of work.  Particularly - how can we develop a simple language/grammar to describe the contrasts that we are most interested in.
