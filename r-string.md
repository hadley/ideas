Better string functions for R
=============================

See e.g. ruby.  Onigirama regexp library?  Look at Gabor's gsubfn as well.

  * count number of matches
  * extract grouped matches easily
  * split that doesn't swallow splitting string, and allow you to set the number of splits
  * grep should return a logical vector
  * regexpr should use NA for non-match
