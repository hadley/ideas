Circular statistics in ggplot2
==============================

When polar coordinates are used, the usual stats should be replace with circular equivalents, e.g. smoothes, density estimation, contours, ...  Currently ggplot2 lacks both the hooks to do this, and implementation of the circular statistics.

Generally, support for circular statistics in R is not great (although there are two packages, they are incomplete/buggy), and part of this project could be a thorough investigation into circular statistics.
