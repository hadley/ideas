Attentive mds ===========================================================

Lay out points with mds.  Select point (or cluster of points) and relayout others to more accurately reflect their distance from the selected points.  See http://www.tom-carden.co.uk/p5/tube_map_travel_times/applet/ for example

In general a set of tools for understanding the quality (both local and global) of an ordination would be very helpful.  Colour by lcmeta, select point and colour neighbours by quality, or emphases local fit and refit (monitoring global fit at the same time)
