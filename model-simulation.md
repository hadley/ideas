Posterior draws from models
===========================

Write code to generate simulation from posteriors for all common model classes: lm, glm, lme4 (probably already done in mcmcsamp) and gam.

Look into Gelman paper on the same topic, and explore automated creation of graphics.  Connections with graphical inference?
