Cluster validation
==================

Interactive graphics for http://www.jstatsoft.org/v25/i04/paper, which also contains a good survey of existing clustering and validation methods implemented in R.  Also look up Fritz's clustering node with neighbourhood connections.

Generally, dig in depth into some statistical model/method and develop new graphics for exploration and diagnosis.
