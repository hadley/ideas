Tick marks 
==========

Ticks marks for:

* linear scales (literature review, can we do better?)
* log scales
* other non-linear scales
* date scales
* multiple facets with different scales

Basic algorithm should be given a region on the screen and:

* work out number and position of ticks
* trade-off between many small labels and few big labels (esp. for categorical data)
