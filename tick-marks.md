Tick marks 
==========

Implementation of: "An Extension of Wilkinsonâ€™s Algorithm for Positioning Tick Labels on Axes", Justin Talbot, Sharon Lin, Pat Hanrahan

Develop grid grob that can automatically deal with variable sizes, selecting the most appealing labels automatically (not sure if this is possible with respect to height, but should at least be able to modify number of labels affecting width)

Extensions:

* incorporate symmetry in criteria
* non-linear scales: log (base 2, 10 , ...), sqrt, reciprocal
* dates
* multiple scales - use minimal set of variations

Develop set of test cases for use in future projects. 

What is a nice number?
